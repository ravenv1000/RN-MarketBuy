# RN-MarketBuy
This script allows you to buy groceries when you go to a grocery store, pay the grocery store's invoice, add products and adjust store buy.
#
This script defines three commands called marketSatinal, urunEkle and invoiceOde. marketSatinal allows players to buy a market, urunEkle allows players to add products and invoiceOde allows players to pay for the market. You can edit the IDs and other details in the script according to your needs. I hope this script will help you.
